Angular
=======

Angular (name up for debate) is (going to be) a clone of the game [Othello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). I've got it working with a very simple AI. 

This project is under active development.

Design is ongoing. Send suggestions [to our designer](http://twitter.com/ashleykrista). Colour theme from [Colour Lovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1932830/Dreaming?widths=0).
