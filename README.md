Angular
=======

Angular (name up for debate) is (going to be) a clone of the game [Othello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). I've got it working with a very simple AI. 

This project is under active development. 

Building
----------------

Standard build. Make sure your Cocoapods install is up to date. Clone the repo, then run `pod install`.

Progress
----------------

- Game model, mechanics, etc ✓
- AI with multiple levels of difficulty ✓
- Board UI ✓
